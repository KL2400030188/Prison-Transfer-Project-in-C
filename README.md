# Prison-Transfer-Project-in-C
The purpose of this project is to create a method for selecting a group of prisoners eligible for transfer from an overcrowded prison to another location. Due to the varying crime severity levels of each prisoner, the mayor has set conditions that restrict which prisoners can be transferred.
